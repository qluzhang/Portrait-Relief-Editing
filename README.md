Abstract: Portrait bas-relief is a three-dimensional sculptural form that bridges the gap between 2D images and 3D objects. Conducting geometric editing on poses and expressions can effectively enhance the diversity and emotional expressiveness of the relief figures. In response to the characteristics of inconsistent thickness and lack of RGB textures in portrait bas-reliefs, we introduce a multi-stage method for the editing of portrait relief pose and expression. Firstly, a relief normal regression model is established to convert the relief normal map into a standard normal map. Secondly, a text-driven generation model is set up to produce RGB portrait corresponding to the relief. Subsequently, an editing model is created to transfer the target pose and expression in normal domain. Finally, a new portrait relief is reconstructed from the transferred normal map through numerical solution. Experimental results indicate that the portrait reliefs generated by our proposed method obtain new poses and expressions consistent with the targets, while effectively preserving identities and face details of the original reliefs.
